      - MODULAR  
      - IT DOES NOT NEEDS SCHEMA
REDIS PERSISTANCE
      - SNAPSHOTS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME OR REQUEST
            -BUT THE LAST MINUTE DATA WILL NOT BE RECOVERED
      - SO REDIS USES AN OTHER WAY TO HANDLE IT 
            - AOF -APPEND ONLY FILE
                - IT WRITES AS A LOG OF EACH REQUEST OF INSERTION
                - IT WILL REWIRE THE DATABSE ON RESTARING OR OVER A LOSS
                - BUT THIS WILL BE SLOWER THAN SNAPSHOTTING
